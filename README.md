# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements a **Car Price Prediction Model** using **Linear Regression** and **Lasso Regression** to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as **year**, **mileage**, **fuel type**, and more. The goal is to help users estimate car prices with a machine learning approach using Python.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 📊
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖
- **Matplotlib** 📈
- **Seaborn** 🎨
- **Colab Notebooks** 📝

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of used car details, including:
- **Year** of manufacture
- **Selling price**
- **Mileage (km driven)**
- **Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, etc.)**
- **Transmission (Manual, Automatic)**
- **Seller type**
- **Car owner details**

### Sample Dataset:
| Car Model               | Year | Selling Price | KM Driven | Fuel  | Seller Type  | Transmission | Owner       |
|-------------------------|------|---------------|-----------|-------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Maruti 800 AC           | 2007 | ₹60,000       | 70,000    | Petrol| Individual   | Manual       | First Owner |
| Hyundai Verna 1.6 SX    | 2012 | ₹6,00,000     | 100,000   | Diesel| Individual   | Manual       | First Owner |
| Honda Amaze VX i-DTEC   | 2014 | ₹4,50,000     | 141,000   | Diesel| Individual   | Manual       | Second Owner|

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.x 💻
- Pandas 🐼
- Numpy 🔢
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🎨


📈 Results
The project implements both Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. The evaluation metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). We also compare the predicted and actual car prices through visualizations using Matplotlib.
